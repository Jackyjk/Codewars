            Description:
            ⚠️ The world is in quarantine! There is a new pandemia that struggles mankind. Each continent is isolated from each other but infected people have spread before the warning. ⚠️
            🗺️ You would be given a map of the world in a type of string:
            s = "01000000X000X011X0X"
            "0" : uninfected
            "1" : infected
            "X" : ocean
            ⚫ The virus can't spread in the other side of the ocean.
            ⚫ If one person is infected every person in this continent gets infected too.
            ⚫ Your task is to find the percentage of human population that got infected in the end.
            ☑️ Return the percentage % of the total population that got infected.
            ❗❗ The first and the last continent are not connected!
            💡 Example:
            start: map1 = "01000000X000X011X0X"
            end:   map1 = "11111111X000X111X0X"
            total = 15
            infected = 11
            percentage = 100*11/15 = 73.33333333333333
            ➕ For maps without oceans "X" the whole world is connected.
            ➕ For maps without "0" and "1" return 0 as there is no population.
